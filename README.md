# LoPoly

Prayash Thapa and Martin Fejka


Some notes on OpenCV: To run LoPoly on your machine you will need some libraries from OpenCV 3.1+ in addition to OpenCV3. Move OpenCV library to your project and ensure that you have referenced the path to wherever you placed the library in your framework search paths (in build settings).
